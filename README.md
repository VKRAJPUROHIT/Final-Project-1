# Final-Project-1
Deploying diabetes predictor to Postman and Heroku
The aim of this project is to deploy machine learning model with Flask. For this project, I am going to help predict the likelihood of a person 
being diagnosed with diabetes based on several diagnostic measurements of that person.The dataset that I have used is from this database: 
https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database .The dataset has 768 records, and all patients are females at least 21 years of
age and of Pima Indian descent.
While this dataset has been used by many people and is cited in many tutorials, there is no clear instructions on how to deploy the diabeted predictor on web sites like
Postman, Heroku, Amazon Sage etc.
This project demonstrates how to deploy diabetes machine learning model to Postman and Heroku
